# cpp-qt-calc
This is my first C++ project, minus the command line calculator that i made, but this is my first REAL project, with ui. This is obviously a clone of the IOS calculator that i made with qt, a ui creating tool with C++, the exe is in the build/release folder. Overall this project was quite simple yet im sure my code isnt the best. I chose to make my code as simple as possible as (obviously) im new to C++. There are a few issues like the display number is always rounded and decimals dont work, im pretty sure that this is because of line 38: QString::number(answer); i think that QString::number only accounts for ints and not longs, which is what answer is. UPDATE, i was stupid, using a long instead of double. Fixed now though.
